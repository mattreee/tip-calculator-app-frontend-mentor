## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Continued development

A lot of the interactivity of the project was done with pure JavaScript, since I'm still diving into React and Sass. It Just felt more practical to do it with JS, but I plan to focus more on adding react's hooks and sass' mixins in my next projects.
